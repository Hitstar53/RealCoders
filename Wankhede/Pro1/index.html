            The Wankhede Stadium is an international cricket stadium in Mumbai, India. The stadium now has a capacity of 33,108, following renovations for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Before the upgrade, the capacity was approximately 45,000.
The stadium has been host to numerous high-profile cricket matches in the past, most notably the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final, in which India defeated Sri Lanka and became the first country to win the cricket world cup on home soil. The stadium played host to the last match of Sachin Tendulkar's international career. Additionally, it hosted many matches during the 1996 and 2011 Cricket World Cups. The stadium also played host to the match in which Ravi Shastri hit six sixes in an over.
