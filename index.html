            <p>India's most beautiful railway station is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture with stained-glass windows, towering spires, domed arches and buttresses and pillars with animal images carved into them.During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main fa√ßade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India.Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed.</p>
