    <h1><p>When in Mumbai, a visit to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) becomes imperative. The national park is also called the lungs of the city and is the only national park in the world known to be present within a city’s premises. Far from the bustle of the city, the environment inside the national park is completely peaceful and offers serenity.</p>
    <p>Spread across a total area of 103 square kilometres, the governing body of the national park is the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the footfall of visitors each year rounds up to a little over 2 million. The entire area of the national park forms approximately 20% of Mumbai’s geographical area.</p>
    <p>The park is home to over 40 species of mammals, 254 species of birds, 150 species of butterflies, 78 species of reptiles and amphibians and last but not the least and most important, over a surprisingly high population of 1300 species of plants.</p>
    <p>At the exit gate of the park, there is a souvenir shop that offers artefacts, coffee table books on SGNP Biodiversity, trekking gears and apparel, books on tribes of Maharashtra, organic consumables and forest produce.</p>
