     <p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai, India. It was            erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in            December 1911 at Ramchandani Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk.
     The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating               elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was             sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of                  basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as                Gujarati architecture of the time.<button>Get to know more...</button></p>
