            <p style="color:aliceblue; font-size: 20px;">The artist community, led by the eminent sculptor, Piloo Pochkhanawala and the doyen of art, Kekoo Gandhy paved the way for the formation of the NGMA Mumbai. The result was the decision to convert the C J hall into a museum for contemporary art. Introducing floor space into the cavernous high-domed interior of a hall designed along the lines of London's fame Royal Albert Hall proved to be an architectural challenge. Not only could the outer shell not be touched according to heritage laws, but the foundation was also found to be weak being on a sandy base. Delhi-based architect  Romy Khosla's design involved constructing a structure within a structure to encase  five-exhibition galleries, one leading to another through stairway, a lecture auditorium, a library, cafeteria, office and storage space for a permanent collection as well as travelling shows. </p>
